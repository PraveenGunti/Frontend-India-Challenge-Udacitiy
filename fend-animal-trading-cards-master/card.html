			<p>The handsome husky is a medium-sized dog with a light, compact frame. His body is well proportioned and muscular. His head may have an interesting black-and-white or red-and-white pattern. His triangle-shaped ears open forward, and the almond-shaped eyes add to his alert, astute expression.

The Siberian Husky holds his head high and his straight back ends in a bushy tail. His coat is quite thick, but the fur sits close to his body and comes in a wide range of colors. Male Huskies average 21 to 23.5 inches in height and 45 to 60 pounds. Females are a bit smaller at 20 to 22 inches and 35 to 50 pounds. </p>
